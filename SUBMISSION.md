## üéØ Project Overview

Zero-Trust Explainer is a comprehensive security scanning and analysis platform for Google Cloud Run services, enhanced with **Google AI Studio** and **Gemini Pro** integration. It transforms complex IAM security findings into actionable insights through intelligent AI analysis, automated remediation code generation, and executive-level reporting.

### The Problem We Solve

Cloud Run security configurations are notoriously complex, with IAM policies, service accounts, and resource permissions creating a web of potential vulnerabilities. Traditional security tools provide raw findings but lack the context and actionable guidance that security teams need to:

- Understand the business impact of security issues
- Prioritize remediation efforts effectively  
- Generate production-ready fix code
- Communicate risk to executives and stakeholders

### Our AI-Powered Solution

Zero-Trust Explainer leverages **Google AI Studio** and **Gemini Pro** to provide:

1. **ü§ñ Intelligent Security Analysis** - AI-powered explanations with blast radius analysis, risk assessment, and business impact
2. **üéØ Smart Risk Prioritization** - AI-driven priority scoring and remediation urgency assessment
3. **üõ†Ô∏è Automated Remediation** - AI-generated Terraform/IAM code with step-by-step implementation guides
4. **üìã Executive Summaries** - AI-powered scan summaries with compliance impact and strategic recommendations

## üìä Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Critical Security Issue
**Finding**: Cloud Run service allows unauthenticated access  
**AI Analysis**: 
- Blast radius: "All internet users can invoke the service"
- Risk assessment: "CRITICAL RISK - Immediate action required"
- Business impact: "High - Potential data breaches and compliance violations"
- Attack vector: "Direct service invocation without authentication"

**AI-Generated Fix**: Complete Terraform code to remove `allUsers` permission with implementation steps and testing recommendations.

### Scenario 2: Service Account Over-Privilege
**Finding**: Service account has Editor role instead of least-privilege access  
**AI Analysis**:
- Blast radius: "Full project access including all resources"
- Risk assessment: "HIGH RISK - Significant attack surface increase"
- Compliance impact: "SOC2 and PCI DSS violations due to excessive permissions"

**AI-Generated Fix**: Terraform code implementing least-privilege IAM roles with specific permissions and conditional access policies.

### Scenario 3: Executive Summary
**AI Summary**: 
- Executive summary: "Security scan completed with 7 findings. 4 high-priority issues require immediate attention..."
- Risk overview: "Overall risk level: HIGH - Multiple critical vulnerabilities detected"
- Top concerns: ["Payment processor exposure", "Excessive permissions", "Plain text secrets"]
- Remediation roadmap: "Phase 1: Critical (1-2 days), Phase 2: High (1 week), Phase 3: Medium/Low (2-4 weeks)"
